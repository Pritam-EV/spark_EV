SessionStart:
1. This page will connect with MQTT.
2. Subscribe to  : topicSessionCommand = "device/" + deviceId + "/sessionCommand";
3. Create sessionid and send these data to backend:
	{sessionId,
      deviceId,
      userId,
      startTime,
      startDate,
      energySelected,
      amountPaid,
      transactionId: txnId,
      sessionstatus: notstarted }
4. Show an image on top and a round big button below it "START CHARGING"
5. Once button is pressed, backend will send start session command to device and backend.
6. always use headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } to send any command.
start session command:
{
      command:       "start",
      sessionId,
      deviceId,
      userId,
      startTime,
      startDate,
      energySelected,
      amountPaid,
      transactionId: txnId,
	sessionstatus: started
    };
7. redirect to LiveSession page.


Live Session Page:
1. Keep connected to MQTT.
2. Subscribe to live session topics like: 
Voltage, current, initialenergy, currentenergy, energyconsumed. 
3. Show stop charging button at bottom.
4. if button pressed, session end command should be sent to backend. trigger = "manual"
5. always use headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } to send commands.
6. session end command:
{ command: "stop", sessionId: session.sessionId, deviceId }
7. UI: At top: You are connected to "DeviceId", its location, chargertype. (extract the data from backend models for the connected device.
At middle: progress bar (amount used/ amount paid), below that live voltage, current and energu consumed values.
At end: charing stop button (emergency)
8. if session ended automatically or by user manually, redirect user to session summary page.
